    ⋄(f, μ::AbstractMeasure) = pushfwd(f, μ)

The `\\diamond` operator denotes a pushforward operation: `ν = f ⋄ μ`
generates a
[pushforward measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure).

A common mathematical notation for a pushforward is ``f_*μ``, but as
there is no "subscript-star" operator in Julia, we use `⋄`.

See [`pushfwd(f, μ)`](@ref) for details.

Also see [`ν ⊙ f`](@ref), the pullback operator.

⋄(f, μ::AbstractMeasure) = pushfwd(f, μ)

@doc raw"""
    ⊙(ν::AbstractMeasure, f) = pullbck(f, ν)

The `\\odot` operator denotes a pullback operation.

See also [`pullbck(ν, f)`](@ref) for details. Note that `pullbck` takes it's
arguments in different order, in keeping with the Julia convention of
passing functions as the first argument. A pullback is mathematically the
precomposition of a measure `μ`` with the function `f` applied to sets. so
`⊙` takes the measure as the first and the function as the second argument,
as common in mathematical notation for precomposition.

A common mathematical notation for pullback in measure theory is
``f \circ μ``, but as `∘` is used for function composition in Julia and as
`f` semantically acts point-wise on sets, we use `⊙`.

Also see [f ⋄ μ](@ref), the pushforward operator.

"""
    μ ▷ k = mbind(k, μ)

The `\\triangleright` operator denotes a measure monadic bind operation.

A common operator choice for a monadics bind operator is `>>=` (e.g. in
the Haskell programming language), but this has a different meaning in
Julia and there is no close equivalent, so we use `▷`.

See [`mbind(k, μ)`](@ref) for details. Note that `mbind` takes its
arguments in different order, in keeping with the Julia convention of
passing functions as the first argument. `▷`, on the other hand, takes
its arguments in the order common for monadic binds in functional
programming (like the Haskell `>>=` operator) and mathematics.

    ∫(f, μ::AbstractMeasure) = mintegrate(f, μ)
